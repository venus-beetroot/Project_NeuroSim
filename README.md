# 🧠 STEAM Project Overview — Project: NeuroSim

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **NeuroSim** project! 

In this game, you'll control a player who can move around the screen and interact with AI Chatbot-integrated NPCs in a small town environment. As we extend features, you could see the characters' memories saved into the cloud or a save file so you can talk with them at any time.

We’re building a **local AI-powered simulation** game using **Python** and **Pygame**, where NPCs talk, remember, and evolve — powered by local LLMs like `llama3.2` from Ollama.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 🧠 AI-powered NPCs with dynamic, local LLM responses  
- 💬 Personalities and memory systems for each NPC  
- 🏠 Building interiors and interactable furniture  
- 👣 Player movement and building entry/exit system  
- 🎮 Game structure built around clean, modular OOP design  
- 🧪 Fully offline AI generation using Ollama + Python
